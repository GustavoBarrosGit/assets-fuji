# Assets created at Fujitsu

This repository contains a collection of assets that were created as part of my internship at Fujitsu. As I showcase the assets, I'll give context for their use in-game.

## Tools Used

- **Autodesk Maya**
- **Blender**

## Project Background & Techniques

### Project Background
The company primarily uses large low-poly asset packs, such as those from Synty Studios. However, despite the size of these packs, there are always gaps in the models. 
I spent a good amount of time filling these gaps by creating 3D models that complemented the visual style, which could then be used by the team.

### Techniques
I mainly used Maya and Blender to create, or edit assets. For texturing I used a simple technique that allows us to quickly texture an object without having to worry about uv maps, which works very well on such low poly assets. 
It is the same technique used by synty studios.
